what is Web Application?
-----------------------
	a web application is a Server side program,that utilizes web browsers and web technologies to perform a task over the web/internet.

	the most of the web applications are implemented by using 3-tier architecture.

what are the requirements needed to developing web applications?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1).Technologies
2).IDE's
3).Design Pattern/architecture
4).Runtime environments

Technologies:
-------------
	Technologies can be categorized into 3-types,they are

	1).Client-side technologies

	2).Server-side technologies

	3).Database technologies

Client-side technologies
-------------------------
	these technologies are used to build the web pages and to perform the client side validations.

	we can run the client-side programs to required web-browsers.

	the client side technologies are html,css,javascript,...

	the web browsers are Chrome,Firefox,safari,opera,...

Server-side technologies:
-------------------------
	these technologies are used to take the request from the client,process that request and give back the response to the enduser/client.

	to perform the server-side validations.

	the server side technologies are Python,Java,.Net,php,ruby,...

	we can execute/run the server-side programs to required webservers(middleware servers).

	the web servers are ApacheTomcat,glasfish,JBoss,WAS,IIS,DDS,...

Database technologies:
----------------------
	these technologies are used to communicate the databases and to perform CURD operations.

	the most common database technology is called SQL(Structured Query Language)

	we can execute the database program's to required Database servers.

	the database servers are Oracle,SQL-Server,MYsql,Sqlite3,
				 Postgresql,...,etc.,


IDE's:
------
IDE's(Integrated Development Environment's)

IDE is a application,which makes easier to build the applications by using any programming language.

	(or)

IDE provides Good environment to writeing any programming language source-code.

IDE's provides Faster development of the Applications
IDE's supports automatic Debugging concept.

ex: Pycharm,Eclipse,Netbeans,Vs code,Atom,Spyder,....etc.,


Design Pattern/Architecture:
----------------------------
	Design Pattern is a solution for the common recurring problems in Object oriented Paradigm.

	the most of the web applications are follows MVC design pattern.

	
Runtime Environments:
---------------------
	after developing an applications,next our applications can anybody access from anywhere with the help of internet/web,in that case we need to required runtime environment/production servers/live environments.

	ex: pythonanywhere,digital-ocean,heroku,cloud(aws,azure,gcp),..

Client-side technologies:
--------------------------
	these technologies are used to build the web-pages and to perform the client side validations.

	HTML	--> Structure of the web pages

	CSS	--> Style to our web pages

	JavaScript  --> Interactivity and client side validations


HTML
----
HTML stands Hyper Text Markup Language.

HTML is a markup language which is used to build the webpages.

HTML provides structure of the webpages.

HTML acontains Elements

HTML elements tell's the browser how to display the content on the webpage.

HTML tag means,any html element represented by using angular brackets.

	<element>content</element>

	ex:
		<p>hello siva</p>

	some tags dont required ending tags that tags are called single tags.

	<element>

	ex:
		<br>

history:
-------
in the year of 1989,Tim-BernersLee implementd www(world wide web)

in the year of 1991,Tim-BernersLee implementd HTML

latest html version is HTML5

structure of the HTML?
----------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
     <head>

     </head>

     <body>

     </body>
</html>

note:
----
if we want to write/implementing any html program dont required any external softwares,just we need to required editors(notepad,notepad++,editplus,...,etc.,) and web browsers(Chrome,FireFox,IE,...,etc.,).

we can save the html programs ".html" or ".htm" extensions.
