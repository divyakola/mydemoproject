what is View?
-------------
	a view is a python function or class,which is used to represent the business logics.

	a view takes the request from the enduser/client,process that request and give back the response to the enduser/client.

	we can implement the views in two way's,they are

	1).Function Based views

	2).Class Based views

Function Based views:
---------------------
	we can implement the views by using functions,that type of views are called Function based views.

	whenever we are sending the request internally our django takes that request,that request is passing to url-dispatcher.

	we can verify that url request is valid or not,wheather it is valid to create request object,that request object is passing to view function and that view function is executed otherwise to raise 404 webpage is not available message on the web browser.

	in function based views we can implement the different http methods like get(),post(),put(),delete(),trace(),move(),...by using conditional statements.

ex:
---
create a django project by using pycharm IDE to print hello world on the webpage?

	double click on pycharmIDE application
		|
	goto file menu
		|
	select new project
		|
	select Django --> set the project name --> select environment or interpreter --> goto more settings --> set the application name --> click on create.


how to start the server in pycharmIDE?
---------------------------------------
	goto tools menu
		|
	select run manage.py taskbar
		|
	  runserver

ex:
---
create a django project with single app and multiple views?

step1:
-----
to create project

	django-admin startproject proj3

step2:
-----
goto project location and to create an application in our project clocation.

	cd proj3

	python manage.py startapp app3

step3:
-----
to install our application in the settings.py file of the project.

	settings.py
	-----------
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    
    'app3'
]

step4:
----
to create function based-views in the views.py file of the application.

	views.py
	--------
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
from datetime import datetime
from calendar import *
# Create your views here.
def wishes(request):
    return HttpResponse("hai siva good evening")

def dateandtime(request):
    now=datetime.now()
    return HttpResponse(now)

def monthofcal(request):    
    c=HTMLCalendar()
    res=c.formatmonth(2021,8)
    return HttpResponse(res)

step5:
----
to configure the url patterns for our views in the urls.py file

	urls.py
	-------
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from app3 import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('wis/',views.wishes),
    path('cdt/',views.dateandtime),
    path('cal/',views.monthofcal)
]

step6:
-----
to apply the migrate

	python manage.py migrate

step7:
-----
to start the server

	python manage.py runserver

step8:
-----
to send the request to the server

	http://127.0.0.1:8000/wis
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/cdt
	http://localhost:8000/cal

structure:
---------
	proj3
	   |---> app3
	   |      |---> views.py
	   |---> proj3
	   |      |---> settings.py
	   |      |---> urls.py
	   |---> manage.py
