django Architecture:
--------------------
whenever the end user to send the request to the server,the dajngo frame take that request and forwarding to the url dispatcher.

url dispatcher is a program that very requested url is valid or not.

we are implement the urls by using regular expressions.

we can implement all the urls in the urls.py file of the project.

our requested url is not matching of any another urls in urls.py file to rasie webpage is not available(404 error) otherwise then control will goto views.

a view is a python function or python class,it takes the request from the end user,process that request and give back the response to the end user.

we can implement all the views in the views.py file of the application in our project.

at the time of processing the client/end-user request the view can be communicating database with the help of models.

a model is a python class,which is used to represent the database related logics.

we can implement all the models in our application in the models.py of the application.

after process the client request the view can transfer the data to the enduser through the templates.

template is a html file which can include python code with the help of some template languages.

template langauge is a special language which is used to achive the html code reusability.

the template languages are DTL,Jinja2

finally the templates give the results to the enduser.
