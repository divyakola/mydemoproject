ex:
---
create a django project to print hello world on the webpage by using templates?

step1:
------
to create a project

	django-admin startproject proj5

step2:
-----
goto project location and to create an application in our project.

	cd proj5

	python maange.py startapp app5

step3:
-----
to install our application in the settings.py file of the project.

	settings.py
	-----------
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    
    'app5'
]

step4:
-----
to create templates and to set the path for our templates in the settings.py file of the project.

	settings.py
	------------
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        
        'DIRS': [BASE_DIR/'templates'],             },
]

step5:
-----
to create a views in views.py file of the application.

	views.py

from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
def welcome(request):
    return render(request,'hello.html')
    
	templates/hello.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>

</html>

step6:
------
to configure the url patterns for our views in the urls.py file.

	urls.py
	-------
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from app5 import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('wel/',views.welcome)
]

step7:

	python manage.py runserver

step9:
-----
to send the request to the server

	http://127.0.0.1:8000/wel

structure:
---------
	proj5
	   |--->app5
	   |      |--->views.py
	   |--->proj5
	   |      |--->settings.py
	   |      |--->urls.py
	   |--->templates
	   |      |--->hello.html
	   |--->manage.py


what is HTTP?
------------
	HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is a web protocol,which is used to enable the communication between client and server.

	we can make the request object by using HttpRequest class

	we can make the response object by using HttpResponse class.

the HttpRequest methods are,

	GET(),POST(),PUT(),DELETE(),MOVE(),.........

the most commonly used HttpRequest methods are GET() and POST() in a web application.

differences between GET() and POST()?
------------------------------------

	GET()				POST()
------------------------------------------------------------
1).it is used to get the data	    1).it is used to post the 
from the server and we can post	       data to the server
the small ammount of data to the       (small,medium,large amount 
server.					of data).


2).we can made the get request in   2).we can made the post req 
3-ways,they are			       in one way,i.e by  
by typeing url on the address bar,     submitting  the form.
by clicking on hyperlinks,
by submitting the form

3).it is a default request	    3).we can made the post 
                                       request manually.

uploading the files                    uploading the files

7).in GET(),the requested url	    7).in POST(),the requested 
is append to the query string          url is not appended to the
                                       query string.


note:
------
whenever we are using GET(),one request object is created that is represented as dictionary object.

that dictionary object data will be loading into GET variable.

	if we want to get the values from GET request object by using hashing.
	request.GET['key']


whenever we are using POST(),one request object is created that is represented as dictionary object.

that dictionary object data will be loading into POST variable.

	if we want to get the values from POST request object by using hashing.
	request.POST['key']
